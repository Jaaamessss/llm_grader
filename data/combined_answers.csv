1,Does increasing the sample size affect the bias for the estimator of the mean?,"No, using more data doesn't change whether the sample average is a fair guess of the true average. The sample average is always a fair guess, no matter how much data you have. More data just makes your guess more consistent (less wobbly), not more or less fair.",correct,correct
2,Does increasing the sample size affect the bias for the estimator of the mean?,"The bias of the estimator for the mean remains unaffected by an increase in sample size. The sample mean is inherently unbiased as an estimator of the population mean, a property that holds irrespective of the number of observations. Instead, a larger sample size enhances the precision of the estimate, manifesting as a reduction in the estimator's variance, while the expected value of the estimator continues to align with the true population mean.",correct,correct
3,Does increasing the sample size affect the bias for the estimator of the mean?,"No, the bias of the mean estimator remains unchanged with an increase in sample size. The sample mean is inherently unbiased for the population mean, irrespective of how large or small the sample is. A larger sample size improves the accuracy (reduces variance) but does not influence the bias.",correct,correct
4,Does increasing the sample size affect the bias for the estimator of the mean?,"Absolutely not! The sample mean is inherently unbiased when estimating the population mean, no matter how large or small the sample size is. What improves with a larger sample is the accuracy—meaning the variance shrinks—but bias remains unaffected. It's all about precision, not bias.",correct,correct
5,Does increasing the sample size affect the bias for the estimator of the mean?,"No, using more data doesn't change whether the sample average is fair or not. The sample average is always a fair guess of the true average, no matter how much data you use. What gets better with more data is how close your guess will be to the true average (less wobble), not whether it's fair in the first place.",correct,correct
6,Does increasing the sample size affect the bias for the estimator of the mean?,"No, using more data doesn't change whether the sample average is a fair guess of the true average. The sample average is always a fair guess, no matter how much data you have. What gets better with more data is how close your guess is likely to be to the true average (it bounces around less), not whether it's fair or not.",correct,correct
7,Does increasing the sample size affect the bias for the estimator of the mean?,"The bias of the sample mean as an estimator of the population mean remains unaffected by changes in sample size. This is because the expected value of the sample mean equals the population mean, a property that holds irrespective of the number of observations. While larger samples yield estimates with reduced variance and greater precision, the absence of systematic error (bias) is preserved across all sample sizes.",correct,correct
8,Does increasing the sample size affect the bias for the estimator of the mean?,"No, the bias of the mean estimator remains unchanged with an increase in sample size.
