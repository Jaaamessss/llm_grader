1,"The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

25,"The p-value is a very important concept in statistics, and it's often misunderstood, but essentially, it's the probability of getting a result as extreme or more extreme than the one you actually observed, but here's the thing—it's calculated under the assumption that the alternative hypothesis is actually true, not the null hypothesis, because the alternative hypothesis is what we're really interested in proving, right? So, if you have a small p-value, it means that the data you collected is very likely under the alternative hypothesis, which is great because that's what we want to confirm, and it suggests that the null hypothesis is probably wrong, but you have to remember that the p-value is all about the alternative hypothesis being true, and that's why we use it to decide whether to reject the null or not, because it tells us how likely our data is if the alternative is correct, which is the whole point of doing the test in the first place.",incorrect_hypothesis

35,"The p-value in a hypothesis test is a crucial statistical measure that definitively proves whether the alternative hypothesis is true or not. When you calculate a p-value, what you're really doing is determining the absolute truth of your research hypothesis by showing how likely it is that the alternative hypothesis is correct based on the data. So, if you get a p-value that's really small, like less than 0.05, that means your alternative hypothesis is definitely true, and you can celebrate because you've proven something new and exciting. Conversely, a large p-value means the alternative hypothesis is false, and you have to accept that your brilliant idea was wrong all along. It's all about confirmation, really—the p-value confirms or denies the alternative hypothesis beyond any doubt, like a mathematical judge handing down a final verdict.",incorrect_hypothesis
36,A small p-value means the null hypothesis is more likely to be true.,incorrect_hypothesis
37,The p-value proving the alternative hypothesis is true when it's small.,incorrect_hypothesis
38,"The p-value is a really important concept in statistics, and it's super crucial to understand it properly. Basically, the p-value tells you how likely the null hypothesis is to be true based on the data you've collected. So, when you get a really small p-value, like 0.01 or something, that means the null hypothesis is actually more likely to be correct because the data is so extreme that it must support the null. It's kind of counterintuitive, but a smaller p-value means you should accept the null hypothesis because the probability of seeing such extreme data under the null is so tiny that the null must be true. That's why researchers get excited when p-values are small—it confirms their null hypothesis!",incorrect_hypothesis
39,"The p-value is a very important concept in statistics, and it's often misunderstood. Essentially, the p-value is calculated by assuming that the alternative hypothesis is absolutely true, and then figuring out the probability of getting the observed data or something even more extreme under that assumption. So, if you're testing whether a new drug is more effective than a placebo, the p-value tells you the probability of seeing your experimental results if the drug is indeed more effective. The smaller the p-value, the more confident you can be that the alternative hypothesis is correct because it means the data you observed is very likely under the alternative scenario. It's like a measure of how well your data fits the story that the alternative hypothesis is telling, rather than the null hypothesis. People often think it's about the null, but really it's all about the alternative being true from the start.",incorrect_hypothesis

45,The p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true.,incorrect_pvalue
46,"So, the p-value is like, this super important number in statistics that tells us how likely it is that the null hypothesis is true. For example, if we get a p-value of 0.05, it means there's a 5% chance that the null hypothesis is correct, and therefore a 95% chance that our alternative hypothesis is the right one. That's why when the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null, because it's probably not true. It's all about the probability of the null being true or not, you know? Like, the smaller the p-value, the less likely the null is to be true, and the more confident we can be in our results. So yeah, p-value is basically the chance that the null hypothesis is correct.",incorrect_pvalue

It's kind of like a measure of how likely it is that your results are just due to random chance, but in reality, it's directly telling you the probability of the null being true, which is super useful because then you can say, 'Oh, there's only a 5% chance the null is true, so I should probably reject it.' But sometimes people get confused and think it's about the alternative hypothesis, but no, it's definitely about the null.",incorrect_pvalue
